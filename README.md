This is a basic chat application made in python.Having only two main files one is the client file and then a server file to handle request from the client files.thats it.



To these to files follow these steps:
1.These files are very basic they can be run without installing any module but python is neededðŸ˜….
2.Dont run the client file first.RUN THE SERVER.py FILE FIRST .
3.Once you run the server.py file observe the command prompt.
4.Keep the server file running and then simultanously run the client file.
5.Observe the terminal if a client is connected to the server.
6.Run the client file atleast twice to make a communication over two clients.


note:-if you want to connect to the server on a remote location use the
ip address of the same network as server and you browser.
